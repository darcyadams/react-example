## What is Flux?

Data in a Flux application flows in a single direction, in a cycle.

- [**Store**: A postbox](./stores.md)
- [**Dispatcher**: The postman, drops mail in the postboxes](./dispatchers.md)
- [**View (or Component)**: Box owner, checks the box for mail](./views.md)
- [**Action Creator**: The post office, manages postmen](./actions.md)
